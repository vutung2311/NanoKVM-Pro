## Introduction

NanoKVM-Pro is the continuation of NanoKVM, inheriting the extreme compactness and powerful expandability of the NanoKVM series as an IP-KVM product.
It has made a significant leap in performance, making it more suitable for remote working scenarios.

To meet different user needs, NanoKVM-Pro offers two forms: NanoKVM-Desk and NanoKVM-ATX:

- **NanoKVM-Desk** is the desktop version of NanoKVM-Pro, featuring an anodized matte metal shell. The front panel has a 1.47-inch touchscreen that displays core KVM information and allows for easy hardware function settings or can be used as a mini secondary screen, providing a more tactile user experience with the left-side infinite knob.

- **NanoKVM-ATX** is the internal version of NanoKVM-Pro, equipped with half-height/full-height brackets for installation inside a case. It allows for easier installation for host users with built-in USB cables and power control interfaces. Remote control can be achieved via external HDMI, network, and USB connections.

NanoKVM-Pro uses the AX630 as its main control core, featuring an ARM 1.2G dual-core A53 CPU. The external 1GB LPDDR4 memory provides strong computing support for remote desktop connections. It has built-in HDMI loop-out and capture chips, offering up to 4K60FPS HDMI loop-out and 4K45FPS video capture. Thanks to AX630's efficient and powerful image processing architecture, NanoKVM-Pro can transmit high-resolution images with very low latency, with typical delays as low as 60ms at 2K resolution.
